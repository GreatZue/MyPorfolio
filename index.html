                <p>Hello, this is a rough draft!  I've been coding for roughly 3 years, and I choose coding because its a super fun creative outlet, and I love having the ability to make things exactly how I imagine them in my head.  Ever since I was a little kid I've taken interest in breaking down video games to see how they work, and modifying them.  I also like the challenge in coding because I'm tenacious and enjoy taking my time with problems.  There's no better feeling than hitting a wall while making a project, and finally getting the coding train moving again after being stuck on that 1 tricky bug! (It was a typo, always a typo!).  As for other things about myself; I have a background in retail/sales, and 3 or 4 years of different laborous jobs where I'm moving around a lot, so I'm eager to give my body a rest!</p>
